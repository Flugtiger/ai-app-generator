  "requirementText": "The `ProjectGenerator` takes as input the `InfrastructureFiles` and the `InterfaceFiles` of the existing software and generates a `FilesDictionary` that contains general project files by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the general prompt, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the project files must follow. The user prompt consists of the `InfrastructureFiles` reduced to only import statements and the `InterfaceFiles` reduced to only the import statements. Import statements are detected by searching for the word \"import\" in the lines at the beginnings of the file contents."
