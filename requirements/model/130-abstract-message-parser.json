  "requirementText": "The `MessageParser` is an abstract domain service. Don't implement it. It can be used to parse file contents from LLM response `Message`s. The Message Parser has a method that returns a pattern for how to define whole files, including an example, for use in system prompts. It also has a corresponding method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a `FilesDictionary` with the parsed files. The `MessageParser` also declares two additional methods for getting the format/syntax of how to edit files and for parsing coresponding edit data from the `Message` of a LLM. The `EditData` consists of tuples of 'Search and Replace' strings together with a file path so an LLM can edit existing files (multiple edits per file should be possible)."
