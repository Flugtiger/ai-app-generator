  "requirementText": "The Domain Model Generator takes as input all model requirements of the DDD model and generates the `DomainModelFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the general prompt, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the generated DDD model must follow. The user prompt consists of the `ModelRequirement`s.\nUse the `MessageParser` service.\nLoad resource files directly from the file system.\nUse the following existing resource files to load the static prompt texts:\nresources/prompts/general.txt : General statements usable in all generators\nresources/prompts/model_preamble.txt : Preamble for the system prompt for generating the domain model\nresources/prompts/model_requirements.txt : General requirements for generating the model"
