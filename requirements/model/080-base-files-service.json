  "requirementText": "The `BaseFilesService` takes the name of a subfolder and a `FilesDictionary` subclass as constructur arguments. Given a project root path, it reads all files inside the subfolder into the `FilesDictionary` subclass but with paths relative to the project root path (subfolder appended). It can also write files from a `FilesDictionary` into the project root path. This `BaseFilesService` will be the base class for services reading and writing specific types of files from the project root folder. The `BaseFilesService` its subclasses and the `FilesDictionary` subclasses should work with both Unix and Windows paths."
