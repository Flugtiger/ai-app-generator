  "requirementText": "The Domain Model Generator takes as input all model requirements of the DDD model and generates the `DomainModelFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the requirements, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the generated DDD model must follow. The preamble and the general requirements are loaded statically from text files inside the Generator. One requirement is that the LLM puts all files into 'src/model' to match the constraint of the `DomainModelFiles` class. The file format is given by the Message Parser service, which is then used to parse the response of the LLM."
