  "requirementText": "The Application Generator takes as input all commands and generates the `ApplicationFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the commands, the `DomainModelFiles` of the existing domain model, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the application code must follow. The preamble and the general requirements are loaded statically from text files inside the Generator. The file format is given by the Message Parser service, which is then used to parse the response of the LLM."
