  "requirementText": "The Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a pattern for how a LLM should output files. The pattern contains the file name, a start token and an end token. The Message Parser provides the pattern together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. When parsing the LLM's response, the message parser must ignore nested file definitions. This is done by counting the occurrences of the start token and only end a file if the count of end tokens matches. The Message Parser should be strict in regards to the pattern it defined to prevent parsing errors. If the parser fails to parse the complete input, it throws an exception."
