  "requirementText": "The Application Generator takes as input all `Command`s and the `DomainModelFiles` of the existing domain model and generates the `ApplicationFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the Commands, the `DomainModelFiles`, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the application code must follow. The preamble and the general requirements are loaded statically from text files inside the Generator. One requirement is that the files in the LLM's response are located in 'src/application' to match the constraint of the `ApplicationFiles`class. The file format is given by the Message Parser service, which is then used to parse the response of the LLM."
