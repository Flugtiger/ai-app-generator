  "requirementText": "The Application Generator takes as input all `Command`s and the `DomainModelFiles` of the existing domain model and generates the `ApplicationFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the Commands, the `DomainModelFiles`, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the application code must follow. The preamble and the general requirements are loaded statically from text files inside the Generator."
