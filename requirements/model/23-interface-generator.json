  "requirementText": "The `InterfaceGenerator` takes as input the `ApplicationFiles`, the `DomainModelFiles` and the `InfrastructureFiles` of the existing software and generates `InterfaceFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the general prompt, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the interface code must follow. The user prompt consists of the `ApplicationFiles` as is, the compressed `DomainModelFiles` and the compressed `InfrastructureFiles`."
