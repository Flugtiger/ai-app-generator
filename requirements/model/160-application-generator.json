  "requirementText": "The Application Generator takes as input all `Command`s and the `DomainModelFiles` of the existing domain model and generates the `ApplicationFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the general prompt, the format of how to specify files and the general requirements the application code must follow. The user prompt consists of the `Command`s and the `DomainModelFiles`.\nUse the `MessageParser` service.\nLoad resource files directly from the file system.\nUse the following existing resource files to load the static prompt texts:\nresources/prompts/general.txt : General statements usable in all generators\nresources/prompts/application_preamble.txt : Preamble for generating the application code\nresources/prompts/application_requirements.txt : General requirements for the application code"
