  "requirementText": "The `InterfaceGenerator` takes as input the `ApplicationFiles`, the `DomainModelFiles` and the `InfrastructureFiles` of the existing software and generates `InterfaceFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the `ApplicationFiles` as is, the compressed `DomainModelFiles`, the compressed `InfrastructureFiles`, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the interface code must follow. The preamble and the general requirements are loaded statically from text files inside the Generator."
