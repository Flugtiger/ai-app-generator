  "requirementText": "The `InterfaceGenerator` takes as input the `ApplicationFiles`, the `DomainModelFiles` and the `InfrastructureFiles` of the existing software and generates `InterfaceFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the general prompt, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the interface code must follow. The user prompt consists of the `ApplicationFiles` as is, the compressed `DomainModelFiles` and the compressed `InfrastructureFiles`.\nUse the `MessageParser` service.\nLoad resource files directly from the file system.\nUse the following existing resource files to load the static prompt texts:\nresources/prompts/general.txt : General statements usable in all generators\nresources/prompts/interface_preamble.txt : Preamble for generating the interface code\nresources/prompts/interface_requirements.txt : General requirements for generating the interface"
