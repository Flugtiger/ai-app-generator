  "requirementText": "The `InfrastructureGenerator` takes as input the `InfrastructureRequirement`s and the `DomainModelFiles` of the existing domain model and generates `InfrastructureFiles` by using a LLM. It does this by assembling a system prompt that is made up from a preamble, the general prompt, the format of how to specify files and general requirements the infrastructure code must follow. The user prompt consists of the `InfrastructureRequirement`s and the `DomainModelFiles`.\nUse the `MessageParser` service.\nLoad resource files directly from the file system.\nUse the following existing resource files to load the static prompt texts:\nresources/prompts/general.txt : General statements usable in all generators\nresource/prompts/infrastructure_preamble.txt : Preamble for infrastructure generation\nresources/prompts/infrastructure_requirements.txt : General requirements for infrastructure generation"
