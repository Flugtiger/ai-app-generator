  "requirementText": "The implementation of the `MessageParser` defines a pattern that contains the file name, a start token (default: '<<<SOF') and an end token (default: 'EOF>>>'). The file name is on the line directly above the start token. The Message Parser implementation provides the pattern together with an example for use in system prompts. When parsing the LLM response message, the message parser implementation expects the start and end tokens to match a whole line to be valid. Only when a start token is detected, the file name is read from the line directly above the start token. The message parser implementation ignores arbitrary text before, after and in between the files in the LLM response message. When parsing the LLM's response, the message parser implementation must ignore nested file definitions. This is done by counting the occurrences of start tokens and only end a file if the count of end tokens matches. If the parser fails to parse the complete input, it throws an exception."
