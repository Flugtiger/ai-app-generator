  "requirementText": "Implement a generic FileRepository class that reads and writes model aggregates from/to json files. Use pydantic V2 APIs to (de-)serialize the model classes. Have all repositories use the generic FileRepository but with individual folders for their json files. The common base folder should be 'data'. The repository generates and sets IDs for new objects inside the `save` method. IDs consist out of short all uppercase prefix (2 or 3 characters) that is derived from the name of the aggregate, a dash and then a number. The number is a natural number that is incremented with each new object. When a `FileRepository` is initialized, it loads the next number that is available for new objects by scanning the json files in it's specific folder. The method that returns all items sorts the items first by length of their ID string and then by the ID string itself."
