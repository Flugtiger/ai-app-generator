================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods need to be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model that fulfills these requirements. Let's start by laying out the key components:

**Aggregate Roots:**
- Aggregate - Main entity with unique name and ID
- AggregateRequirement - Requirement for an aggregate with text description
- Command - Interaction with a name that acts upon an aggregate

**Value Objects:**
- AggregateId - ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId - ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId - ID for Command

Let's implement these components:

This concludes a fully working implementation. The model follows DDD principles with:

1. Aggregate roots (Aggregate, AggregateRequirement, Command)
2. Value objects for IDs with type hints in their string representation
3. Factory methods in the Aggregate class to create related objects
4. Auto-generated IDs when objects are created
5. Proper encapsulation and assertions for state changes
6. Clean separation of concerns with each class in its own file
7. Pydantic models for easy serialization/deserialization

General requirements for application code:

- the code of a specific application command must be written as a single function in a dedicated file
- the inputs of the command should be modeled as a data transfer object (DTO), the name of the DTO class must be suffixed with 'Input'
- the outputs of the command should also be modeled with a DTO, the suffix must be 'Output'
- the names of the application code function and its DTOs should match to that extend, that it's clear they belong together

I'll implement the application code for the `createAggregate` command based on the provided DDD model. Let's start by identifying the necessary components:

1. We need to create an application command function that creates a new Aggregate
2. We need input and output DTOs for this command
3. We need a repository interface and implementation for Aggregate persistence

This concludes a fully working implementation. The implementation includes:

1. A repository interface and in-memory implementation for Aggregate persistence
2. A command function `create_aggregate` with appropriate input and output DTOs
3. A command handler for the createAggregate command
4. A service that uses the command handler
5. A main entry point that demonstrates the usage of the service

The implementation follows the DDD principles and uses the provided model classes. The command creates a new Aggregate, saves it to the repository, and returns information about the created Aggregate.

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list files that make up a DDD model and a description of a command on that model. You must write the application code that executes the command on the model.
Usually the application code will load model aggregates from their respective repositories, call functions on them to modify their state and then save the updates aggregates in their repository.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for application code:

- the code of a specific application command must be written as a single function in a dedicated class in a dedicated file, all dependencies (e.g. repositories, domain services) must be specified as constructor parameters of the class.
- the inputs of the command should be modeled as a data transfer object (DTO), the name of the DTO class must be suffixed with 'Input'
- the outputs of the command should also be modeled with a DTO, the suffix must be 'Output'
- the names of the application code function and its DTOs should match to that extend, that it's clear they belong together
- only write the code that directly interacts with the model (and the mentioned DTOs), don't generate any additional services, examples, main scripts!
- the application code must be ignorant of any infrastructure and only interact with the model (aggregates, repositories, domain services, ...)

I'll implement the application code for the `createAggregate` command based on the provided DDD model. Let's start by identifying the necessary components:

1. An application service class for creating aggregates
2. Input and Output DTOs for the command
3. Interaction with the AggregateRepository

Let's implement these components:

src/application/commands/create_aggregate_command.py
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
from src.domain.aggregates.aggregate import Aggregate
from src.domain.repositories.aggregate_repository import AggregateRepository
from src.domain.value_objects.aggregate_id import AggregateId


class CreateAggregateInput(BaseModel):
    """
    Input data for creating a new Aggregate.
    """
    name: str
    aggregate_id: Optional[str] = None


class CreateAggregateOutput(BaseModel):
    """

    """
    aggregate_id: str
    name: str


class CreateAggregateCommand:
    """
    Application service command for creating a new Aggregate.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, aggregate_repository: AggregateRepository):
        """
        Initialize the command with required dependencies.
        """
        self.aggregate_repository = aggregate_repository
    
    def execute(self, input_data: CreateAggregateInput) -> CreateAggregateOutput:
        """
        Execute the command to create a new Aggregate.
        
        Args:
            input_data: The input data containing the name and optional ID for the new Aggregate.
            
        Returns:
            Output data containing the ID and name of the created Aggregate.
            
        Raises:
            ValueError: If an Aggregate with the provided ID already exists.
        """
        # If an ID was provided, convert it to an AggregateId
        aggregate_id = None
        if input_data.aggregate_id:
            aggregate_id = AggregateId(input_data.aggregate_id)
            
            # Check if an aggregate with this ID already exists
            if self.aggregate_repository.exists(aggregate_id):
                raise ValueError(f"Aggregate with ID {aggregate_id} already exists")
        
        # Create a new Aggregate
        aggregate = Aggregate(
            name=input_data.name,
            id=aggregate_id
        )
        
        # Save the Aggregate to the repository
        self.aggregate_repository.save(aggregate)
        
        # Return the output DTO
        return CreateAggregateOutput(
            aggregate_id=str(aggregate.id),
            name=aggregate.name
        )
```

This concludes a fully working implementation. The `CreateAggregateCommand` class handles the creation of a new Aggregate entity. It takes an `AggregateRepository` as a dependency in its constructor, and provides an `execute` method that accepts a `CreateAggregateInput` DTO and returns a `CreateAggregateOutput` DTO. The command creates a new Aggregate with the provided name (and optional ID), saves it to the repository, and returns the details of the created Aggregate.

You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods need to be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by an apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on your requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate - represents a DDD aggregate with a unique name and ID
- AggregateRequirement - represents requirements for an aggregate
- Command - represents a specific interaction in the system

Value Objects:
- AggregateId - ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId - ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId - ID for Command
- FilesDictionary - maps file paths to content
- DomainModel - specific subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService - abstract service for LLM interactions
- ModelGenerator - generates/modifies DDD model code
- DiffParser - parses unified diffs

Now, let's implement these components:

- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has a unique name and ID, can be modified
- AggregateRequirement: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate it affects
- Command: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate it acts upon

Value Objects:
- AggregateId: ID for Aggregates
- AggregateRequirementId: ID for AggregateRequirements
- CommandId: ID for Commands
- FilesDictionary: Maps file paths to content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract): Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser: Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator: Generates code for DDD model using LLM

Now, let's implement each component:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has a unique name and ID, can be modified
- AggregateRequirement: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, contains requirement text
- Command: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, has a name that can be modified

Value Objects:
- AggregateId: ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId: ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId: ID for Command
- FilesDictionary: Maps repository-relative paths to file content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract): Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser: Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator: Generates code for DDD model using LLM

Now, let's implement each component:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has a unique name and ID, can be modified
- AggregateRequirement: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, contains requirement text
- Command: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, has a name that can be modified

Value Objects:
- AggregateId: ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId: ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId: ID for Command
- FilesDictionary: Maps repository-relative paths to file content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract): Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser: Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator: Generates code for DDD model using LLM

Now, let's implement each component:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file
If the CODE contains a line that consists out of three backticks (```), you MUST add a backslash to the beginning of this line to escape it, e.g. \```

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has a unique name and ID, can be modified
- AggregateRequirement: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, contains requirement text
- Command: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, has a name that can be modified

Value Objects:
- AggregateId: ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId: ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId: ID for Command
- FilesDictionary: Maps repository-relative paths to file content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract): Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser: Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator: Generates code for DDD model using LLM

Now, let's implement these components:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has a unique name and ID, can be modified
- AggregateRequirement: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, contains requirement text
- Command: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, has a name that can be modified

Value Objects:
- AggregateId: ID for Aggregate
- CommandId: ID for Command
- AggregateRequirementId: ID for AggregateRequirement
- FilesDictionary: Maps repository-relative paths to file content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract): Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser: Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator: Generates code for DDD model using LLM

Now, let's implement these components:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file
If the CODE contains thre backtick characters on a single line, you MUST prepend a backslash to that line to not break the file representation from above.
The backslash will be removed before the file is written to disk.

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
print("""
Three backticks on a single line:
\```
""")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has a unique name and ID, can be modified
- AggregateRequirement: Created from an Aggregate, contains requirement text
- Command: Created from an Aggregate, has a name that can be modified

Value Objects:
- AggregateId: ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId: ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId: ID for Command
- FilesDictionary: Maps repository-relative paths to content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract): Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser: Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator: Generates code for DDD model using LLM

Now let's implement these components:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file
IMPORTANT: Make sure that the code NEVER contains three backticks (```) or else I cannot parse your response and all your hard work would be lost!
If you really need to insert three backticks (```) into the CODE, write <THREE_BACKTICKS> instead.

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has ID, name, can create Requirements and Commands
- Command: Has ID, name, references an Aggregate
- ModelGenerator: Domain service that generates code using LLM

Other Classes:
- AggregateRequirement: Entity that references an Aggregate and contains requirement text
- FilesDictionary: Value object mapping file paths to content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary
- LlmService: Abstract domain service for LLM interactions
- MessageParser: Domain service for parsing LLM responses

Let's implement these components:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!


================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate - An entity with a unique name and ID
- AggregateRequirement - An entity that references an Aggregate and contains requirement text
- Command - An entity that references an Aggregate and has a name

Value Objects:
- AggregateId - ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId - ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId - ID for Command
- FilesDictionary - Maps file paths to content
- DomainModel - A subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract) - Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser - Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator - Generates code for the DDD model using LLM

Now, let's implement these components:

You are an expert in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean code architecture.
You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

{self._message_parser.get_file_template()}

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!

You are an expert in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean code architecture.
You will get a list of requirements and the current implementation of a DDD model.
Your task is to modify the existing model to fulfill the new requirements.
You will only output the changes needed as unified diffs for each file that needs to be modified.

{self._message_parser.get_diff_template()}

Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
Only output diffs for files that need to be changed. If a new file needs to be created, include the entire file as a diff.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
You MUST put all files inside the folder "src/model", e.g. "src/model/<aggregate_name>/aggregate_name.py" or "src/model/services/domain_service.py".
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!

================================ Human Message =================================

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Aggregate (part of a DDD model) has a unique name and an ID. The name of an aggregate can be modified after the aggregate was created. Aggregate Requirements can be created from an Aggregate. Commands can be created from an Aggregate.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for an Aggregate inside a DDD model. Such a requirement references the main aggregate that it effects. Also they contain arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Aggregate that it acts upon. It has a name. The name can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- Aggregate: Has a unique name and ID, can be modified
- AggregateRequirement: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, contains requirement text
- Command: Created from an Aggregate, references the Aggregate, has a name that can be modified

Value Objects:
- AggregateId: ID for Aggregate
- AggregateRequirementId: ID for AggregateRequirement
- CommandId: ID for Command
- FilesDictionary: Maps repository-relative paths to file content
- DomainModel: Subtype of FilesDictionary

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract): Handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser: Parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses
- ModelGenerator: Generates code for DDD model using LLM

Now let's implement these components:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list files that make up a DDD model and a descriptions of commands on that model. You must write the application code that executes the commands on the model.
Usually the application code will load model aggregates from their respective repositories, call functions on them to modify their state and then save the updated aggregates in their repository.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
You MUST put all files inside the folder "src/application", e.g. "src/application/service.py"!
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for application code:

- the code of a specific application command must be written as a single function, all dependencies (e.g. repositories, domain services) must be specified as constructor parameters of the class where the function is inside
- you can put multiple application command functions inside one class, if it makes sense to cluster them together
- the inputs of a command should be modeled as a data transfer object (DTO), the name of the DTO class must be suffixed with 'Input'
- the outputs of a command should also be modeled with a DTO, the suffix must be 'Output'
- DTOs should have their own files
- the names of the application code function and its DTOs should match to that extend, that it's clear they belong together
- only write the code that directly interacts with the model (and the mentioned DTOs), don't generate any additional services, examples, main scripts!
- the application code must be ignorant of any infrastructure and only interact with the model (aggregates, repositories, domain services, ...)
- The user should not be able to specify the IDs of objects that are to be newly created if not explicitly requested.

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list of requirements and you must write a clean DDD Model as code that fulfills all given requirements.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the Model is, in the end, implemented as code.
You will not write any infrastructure code, example code or anything else that should not be part of a technology-free domain model.
Domain services that only use the languages base library to fulfill their tasks are considered 'technology-free', so go ahead and implement them.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
You MUST put all files inside the folder "src/model", e.g. "src/model/<aggregate_name>/aggregate_name.py" or "src/model/services/domain_service.py".
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for a clean DDD model that you MUST follow:

- IDs should have their own value object class and they should have a serialized form that gives a hint to what type of object they belong to
- IDs of aggregates and entities are auto generated when a fresh object is created.
- aggregates must only reference other aggregates via the ID of the aggregate root
- generate a Repository for each Aggregate that needs to be persisted
- a Repository MUST be abstract (the implementation is not part of the model)
- a Repository MUST have a function `get_by_id` and a function `save` but it MUST NOT have more functions than that
- if an object is to be created from an existing object, put a factory method in the class of the existing object, e.g. if a House is needed to create an Apartment, it should be possible to write: house.create_apartment(...), this factory method should call the constructor of the class of the object to be created, not another wrapper!
- private methods must be prefixed with an underscore
- make assertions about the model state before the actual code in the model methods
- use enums to restrict values
- aggregates and value objects must not depend on or call domain services!

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Request: An Bounded Context has a unique name and an ID. The ID is a string that is maximum four characters long. The name of a Bounded Context can be modified after the it was created. Model Requirements can be created from a Bounded Context. Commands can be created from a Bounded Context.\nAs a User, I want to define requirements for a DDD model. These requirements reference the Bounded Context they are defined within. A model requirement contains arbitrary text that describes the requirement (attribute: requirementText).\nA Command is a specific type of interaction in the software System. It references the Bounded Context that it part of. It has a name and a description. The name and description can be modified after the Command has been created.\nA Files Dictionary is a value object which contains the repository-relative paths of source code files mapped to their content.\nThere is an abstract domain service that handles the interactions with a LLM (chat model). It takes 'messages' as input and returns the response message from the LLM. The actual implementation is not part of the DDD model but will be part of the infrastructure layer.\nThe Message Parser domain service can be used to parse file contents from LLM responses. To do so, it defines a template for how a LLM should output files. The Message Parser provides the template together with an example for use in system prompts. It has a method for parsing a LLM response message that returns a File Dictionary with the parsed files. All these statements regarding the Message Parser do also apply to the second functionality implemented by the Message Parser: Parsing unified diffs from a LLM response message. The client of the Message Parser decides wether the 'whole files' template is used in a system prompt, then the parsing function parsing whole file contents must be used, or the diff template is used in the system prompt, then the diff parsing method has to be used.\nThe Model Generator takes as input the requirements of the DDD model and generates the code of the DDD model by using a LLM. It has a method to generate the model from scratch and a method which modifies the existing model. The result of both is a specific sub-type of a Files Dictionary called 'Domain Model'. The function to modify the existing model also takes the current Domain Model as input. The Model Generator uses the abstract LLM service to generate the model. It specifies a system prompt that makes the LLM generate a clean DDD model. The response of the LLM is parsed to extract source code files from it. In function that modifies the existing model, the LLM is asked to generate unified diffs that are then parsed and applied to the input domain model. This parsing should be handled by the apropriate domain service.\n"}]

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll create a clean DDD model based on the requirements. Let's start by identifying the key components:

Aggregate Roots:
- BoundedContext - manages its identity, name, and creates ModelRequirements and Commands
- ModelGenerator - handles the generation of domain models using LLM

Value Objects:
- BoundedContextId - represents the unique ID of a BoundedContext
- FilesDictionary - maps file paths to content
- DomainModel - specialized FilesDictionary for domain model code
- Message - represents messages for LLM communication

Entities:
- ModelRequirement - represents a requirement for a DDD model
- Command - represents a command in the system

Domain Services:
- LlmService (abstract) - handles interactions with LLM
- MessageParser - parses file contents and diffs from LLM responses

Now, let's implement these components:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list files that make up a DDD model and a descriptions of commands on that model. You must write the application code that executes the commands on the model.
Usually the application code will load model aggregates from their respective repositories, call functions on them to modify their state and then save the updated aggregates in their repository.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
You MUST put all files inside the folder "src/application", e.g. "src/application/service.py"!
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add ONLY comments explaining very complex bits of logic. DO NOT comment every line!
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for application code:

- the code of a specific application command must be written as a single function, all dependencies (e.g. repositories, domain services) must be specified as constructor parameters of the class where the function is inside
- you can put multiple application command functions inside one class, if it makes sense to cluster them together
- the inputs of a command should be modeled as a data transfer object (DTO), the name of the DTO class must be suffixed with 'Input'
- the outputs of a command should also be modeled with a DTO, the suffix must be 'Output'
- DTOs should have their own files
- the names of the application code function and its DTOs should match to that extend, that it's clear they belong together
- only write the code that directly interacts with the model (and the mentioned DTOs), don't generate any additional services, examples, main scripts!
- the application code must be ignorant of any infrastructure and only interact with the model (aggregates, repositories, domain services, ...)
- The user should not be able to specify the IDs of objects that are to be newly created if not explicitly requested.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I'll implement the application code for the commands you've requested. Let's start by identifying the key components:

1. Aggregate Roots: BoundedContext
2. Commands: Create Aggregate, Create Aggregate Requirement, Generate Model, Rename Aggregate
3. Repositories: BoundedContextRepository, ModelRequirementRepository
4. Services: ModelGenerator, LlmService

Let's implement each command as an application service:

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list files that make up a DDD model and a descriptions of commands on that model. You must write the application code that executes the commands on the model.
Usually the application code will load model aggregates from their respective repositories, call functions on them to modify their state and then save the updated aggregates in their repository.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
You MUST put all files inside the folder "src/application", e.g. "src/application/service.py"!
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add ONLY comments explaining very complex bits of logic. DO NOT comment every line!
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for application code:

- the code of a specific application command must be written as a single function, all dependencies (e.g. repositories, domain services) must be specified as constructor parameters of the class where the function is inside
- you can put multiple application command functions inside one class, if it makes sense to cluster them together
- the inputs of a command should be modeled as a data transfer object (DTO), the name of the DTO class must be suffixed with 'Input'
- the outputs of a command should also be modeled with a DTO, the suffix must be 'Output'
- DTOs should have their own files
- the names of the application code function and its DTOs should match to that extend, that it's clear they belong together
- only write the code that directly interacts with the model (and the mentioned DTOs), don't generate any additional services, examples, main scripts!
- the application code must be ignorant of any infrastructure and only interact with the model (aggregates, repositories, domain services, ...)
- The user should not be able to specify the IDs of objects that are to be newly created if not explicitly requested.

================================ System Message ================================

You will get a list files that make up a DDD model and a descriptions of commands on that model. You must write the application code that executes the commands on the model.
Usually the application code will load model aggregates from their respective repositories, call functions on them to modify their state and then save the updated aggregates in their repository.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the aggregate roots, other classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
SOF```
CODE
```EOF

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
SOF```
print("Hello World")
```EOF

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the files of the "aggregate roots", then go to the ones that are imported by these files, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Do not include package manager dependency definition files.
The model should be free of technologies, except pydantic.
Use pydantic as the base for the model classes to make serialization and deserialization easier.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the model are present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
You MUST put all files inside the folder "src/application", e.g. "src/application/service.py"!
ALWAYS put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
Always add a comment on function level briefly describing the purpose of the function.
NEVER add a comment for every line of code!
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

General requirements for application code:

- the code of a specific application command must be written as a single function, all dependencies (e.g. repositories, domain services) must be specified as constructor parameters of the class where the function is inside
- you can put multiple application command functions inside one class, if it makes sense to cluster them together
- the inputs of a command should be modeled as a data transfer object (DTO), the name of the DTO class must be suffixed with 'Input'
- the outputs of a command should also be modeled with a DTO, the suffix must be 'Output'
- NEVER include input data in the output DTOs if not explicitly specified
- skip generating empty output DTOs completely
- the names of the application code function and its DTOs should match to that extend, that it's clear they belong together
- only write the code that directly interacts with the model (and the mentioned DTOs), don't generate any additional services, examples, main scripts!
- the application code must be ignorant of any infrastructure and only interact with the model (aggregates, repositories, domain services, ...)
- The user should not be able to specify the IDs of objects that are to be newly created if not explicitly requested.
